      George Sexton.
Changed README to put tumgreyspf in recipient restrictions, not sender.

A patch from Scott Scriven which implements a new setting,
      "ignoreLastByte".  When set, the last byte of the IP address is
      ignored so that mail servers in a pool of the same /24 network block

      (reported by Stephen Warren)

      a number of ways with his pre-existing postfix configuration files.

      of automatic.

No configuration of the main program is necessary now.
Greylist data file ctime/atime is now updated when a new message comes in.
